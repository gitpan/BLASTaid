       -- Version 0.0.1 index files will not work with this version:
          re-compile the index using this version.
       -- Index order now corresponds to order of queries in the
          multi-report BLAST file.
       -- ID parse is a little lazier now; previous regex was being
          too restrictive.
       -- Index output now includes if alignements are in the report
          (TRUE) or no alignments (FALSE).
       -- Index output now includes type of BLAST per report.
       -- Partial report is no longer restricted to "EXIT CODE 0";
          simply requires an EXIT CODE to continue.
       -- The "each_report" method now supports an "ignore"
          attribute... for ignoring entries without alignments.
       -- Added the following external methods: type; undef.
